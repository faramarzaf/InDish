     * LOMBOK
     *
     * entity
     * @ToString for toString pojo
     * @AllArgsConstructor
     * if you want for example constructor without id, you should make that in traditional way.
     *
     *  another usage--> for example you have a dependency like this.
     *
     * 		private final CustomService service;
     *        @AutoWired
     *        public controller(CustomService service ){
     * 		    this.service=service
     *        }
     *      you can delete ####controller### and the just add AllArgsConstructor
     *
     *
     * if you have a class that you want log in that
     * @Slf4j
     * and then in methods --> log.info();
     *
     * @Data ---> getter + setter + toString + equal-and-hashcode + RequiredArgsConstructor
     *
